# Emunittest Unity Browser WebAssembly Benchmark Suite

This repository contains a test suite for benchmarking WebAssembly based Unity content in web browsers.

It consists of a number of classic Unity and Dots/Tiny Unity compiled demos, that have been converted to run deterministically in the browser. This enables comparing browser performance, and testing against bugs.

The result data that emunittest provides looks something like this

```
 Run Date         | Test Name                             | Total time (lower is better) |   FPS | CPU Time |   WebGL CPU Time | WebGL calls/frame| CPU Idle | Page load time | # of janked frames | Used JS Mem

# Installation

To install the suite for local use, run

```
git clone https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/emunittest.git
cd emunittest
python install.py
```

To update an existing installation to a newer version, run

```
cd /path/to/emunittest
git pull
python install.py
```

# Running

After installing, launch `start_server.bat` (or `./start_server` on Linux and macOS) to spin up an ad hoc web server at `http://localhost:6932/` to host the content.

Then navigate to `http://localhost:6932/` to visit the launcher.

There are three main ways to run:

1. Run the full suite by clicking on `Run tests` button in the launcher.
2. Run a single test by clicking on `Test` to the right side of the test name.
3. Run a single demo in interactive mode by clicking on `Launch` button next to a test. In this mode the content runs unmodified to the original build from Unity.

Additionally there are a few options to customize how the content is run, e.g. one can disable vsync (uses postMessage() to self to render instead of rAF()), embed a CPU frametime profiler graph, or run the suite in a torture test mode.
